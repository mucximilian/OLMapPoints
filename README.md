# OLMapPoints
A simple OpenLayers web mapping application that allows the user to add points which can then be shared via the URL. Currently only one point can be added by clicking on the map. The anchor part of the URL updates itself dynamically to allow the sharing of a location. See [http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_location.asp](here) for more information about the URL anchor/hash part.

## TO DOs:
*Add more points to the URL anchor
*Implement point dragging
